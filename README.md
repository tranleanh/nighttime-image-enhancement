# Nighttime low illumination image enhancement using Dark/Bright channel priors

- This is the implementation of nighttime low illumination image enhancement using dark/bright channel priors.
- This project is developed based on [1] & [2] for optimal processing speed.
- Paper: [Nighttime low illumination image enhancement with single image using bright/dark channel prior](https://jivp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13640-018-0251-4)

## 0. Dependencies
- Python 3x
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## 1. Usage
1. Set name or path of image in [bcp-dcp.py](https://github.com/tranleanh/nighttime-image-enhancement/edit/master/bcp-dcp.py#L138)
2. Simply run:
```bashrc
$ python bcp-dcp.py
```

## 2. Result

- Input:

<img src="images/val00-16-2-2-FRONT_LEFT.jpg" width="600">

- Output:

<img src="images/val00-16-2-2-FRONT_LEFT_enhanced.jpg" width="600">
